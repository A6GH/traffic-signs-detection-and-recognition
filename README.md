# traffic_signs_detection_and_recognition
Real-time traffic signs detection and recognition implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 with RPi Camera (Google Coral Edge TPU USB Accelerator recommended)

To run the program:
	- Connect to RPi over SSH
	- Execute streaming_server.py
	(The program will start the streaming server on port 2105 so you can type RPi_IP:2105 in your browser to watch the stream and see the detected signs).
